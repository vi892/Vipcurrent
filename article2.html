      <p class="meta">By VIP CURRENT | July 7, 2025</p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>India and Pakistan, since their independence in 1947, have fought several wars and skirmishes that have shaped South Asian geopolitics. The major wars occurred in 1947-48, 1965, 1971, and the Kargil conflict of 1999.</p>

      <h2>1947-48 Kashmir War</h2>
      <p>This was the first war over the princely state of Jammu & Kashmir, which set the foundation for decades of tension. It ended with the establishment of the Line of Control (LoC) but left the Kashmir issue unresolved.</p>

      <h2>1965 War</h2>
      <p>The 1965 war was triggered by disputes over Kashmir and saw intense battles on both Western and Eastern fronts. The war ended in a stalemate with the Tashkent Agreement brokered by the Soviet Union.</p>

      <h2>1971 War & Bangladesh Liberation</h2>
      <p>Perhaps the most decisive conflict, the 1971 war led to the creation of Bangladesh. India’s victory demonstrated its growing military strength and geopolitical influence in the region.</p>

      <h2>Kargil Conflict 1999</h2>
      <p>In 1999, Pakistan’s infiltration in Kargil led to a limited but intense conflict at high altitudes. India successfully regained control of the occupied peaks, showcasing the bravery of its armed forces.</p>

      <h2>Impact on South Asia</h2>
      <p>These wars not only strained relations but also spurred nuclear developments and shaped alliances. Today, India and Pakistan’s ties remain complex, with periods of peace efforts followed by renewed tensions.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Understanding the history of India-Pakistan wars is essential for anyone following South Asian geopolitics. These conflicts continue to influence security policies, regional stability, and diplomatic engagements.</p>
